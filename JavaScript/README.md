### 1. Palindrome Checker () 

Return `true` if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return `false`.

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

**Note**: You'll need to remove all **non-alphanumeric characters** (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the 

same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as `racecar`, `RaceCar`, and `race CAR` among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as `2A3*3a2`, `2A3 3a2`, and `2_A3*3#A2`.

### 2. Roman Numeral Converter (romanNumeralConverter.js)

Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

All [roman](https://www.mathsisfun.com/roman-numerals.html) numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.

### 3. Caesars Cipher (cesarCipher.js)

One of the simplest and most widely known *ciphers* is a *Caesar cipher*, also known as a shift cipher. In a *shift cipher* the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus `A ↔ N`, `B ↔ O` and so on.

Write a function which takes a [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.
